University Admission Chances Predictor:
This project aims to assist university applicants in assessing their chances of gaining admission to their desired universities using a linear regression model. By inputting their academic credentials, applicants can obtain an estimated probability of admission and gain valuable insights into areas of improvement.


In this project, I have built a linear regression model using a dataset containing various features such as GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, statement of purpose (SOP), letter of recommendation (LOR), CGPA, and research experience, with the target variable being the chance of admission.

I took the following steps in this project:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed EDA to gain insights into the data distribution and identify any patterns or correlations among the features.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and feature scaling was applied to ensure fair weightage to each feature during model training.

Model Training: A linear regression model was trained on the training data to learn the relationships between input features and the chance of admission.

Model Evaluation: I evaluated the model's performance using the R-squared score, indicating how well the model fits the data.

Predictions: The trained model can make predictions on new input data. I've provided two examples of prediction inputs to showcase how applicants can input their scores and credentials to estimate their admission chances.

Model Interpretation: I explored model interpretation to understand the importance of each feature in determining admission chances. By analyzing the coefficients obtained from the linear regression model, I identified which features had the most significant impact on admission chances.

Dataset: 
The dataset used for this project was sourced from kaggle. It contains the necessary features and target variable for training the admission chances predictor model.


Usage: 
To use the University Admission Chances Predictor, follow these steps:

Provide your academic credentials, including GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and research experience.

Input your data into the predictor, and it will provide you with an estimated probability of admission to your desired universities.

Review the model's interpretation to identify areas of improvement in your application, such as increasing your GRE score or CGPA.

Model Interpretation
The model interpretation section of this project provides insights into the importance of each feature in determining admission chances. This information can help applicants focus on improving specific areas to enhance their chances of admission.
